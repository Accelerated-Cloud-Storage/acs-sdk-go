### Go version support policy

The SDK follows the upstream [release policy](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#policy)
with an additional six months of support for the most recently deprecated
language version.

**ACS reserves the right to drop support for unsupported Go versions earlier to
address critical security issues.**

## Getting started
[![Website](https://img.shields.io/badge/Website-Console-blue)](https://acceleratedcloudstorage.io) [![API Reference](https://img.shields.io/badge/API-Reference-blue.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/AcceleratedCloudStorage/acs-sdk-go) [![Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Demo-Videos-blue.svg)](https://www.youtube.com/@AcceleratedCloudStorageSales) 

To get started working with the SDK setup your project for Go modules, and retrieve the SDK dependencies with `go get`. This example shows how you can use the SDK to make an API request using the SDK's client.

#### Get credentials

Get your credentials and setup payments from the console on the [website](https://acceleratedcloudstorage.io).

Next, set up credentials (in e.g. ``~/.acs/credentials``):
```
default:
    access_key_id = YOUR_KEY
    secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET
```
Note: You can include multiple profiles and set them using the ACS_PROFILE environment variable. See the examples/config folder for a sample file. 

#### Initialize Project
```sh
$ mkdir ~/helloacs
$ cd ~/helloacs
$ go mod init helloacs
```
#### Add SDK Dependencies
```sh
$ go get github.com/AcceleratedCloudStorage/acs-sdk-go/client
```

#### Write Code
You can either use the client for an interface similar to the AWS SDK or a FUSE mount for a file system interface. Check out the example folder for more details.

## Share bucket

You can also bring your existing buckets into the service by setting a bucket policy and then sharing the bucket with the service.

### Step 1: Setting a bucket policy

Here is the AWS reference guide for [bucket policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/add-bucket-policy.html). You can set the following bucket policy through the AWS Console or SDK to enable ACS to access it.

```
{
"Version": "2012-10-17",
   "Statement": [
    {
     "Sid": "AllowUserFullAccess", 
     "Effect": "Allow",
     "Principal": {
      "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::160885293701:root"
     },
     "Action": [
      "s3:*"
     ],
     "Resource": [
      "arn:aws:s3:::BUCKETNAME",
      "arn:aws:s3:::BUCKETNAME/*"
     ]
    }
   ]
}
```

### Step 2: Notify ACS of this newly shared bucket

```
// Create a new client
acsClient, err := client.NewClient(&client.Session{Region: "us-east-1"})
defer acsClient.Close()
// Share a bucket
err = client.ShareBucket(context, BUCKETNAME)
```
