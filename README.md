### Go version support policy

The SDK follows the upstream [release policy](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#policy)
with an additional six months of support for the most recently deprecated
language version.

**ACS reserves the right to drop support for unsupported Go versions earlier to
address critical security issues.**
